## Exercise 5 - Create a Fallback offer

Fallback offers are default offers which are shown to customers who don’t qualify for any of your personalized offers. We need to create a placement and representation content for our email banner, email text and mobile text for our Fallback offer. 

To create a fall back offer, follow these steps:

1.	In the Browse tab, click “Create offer,” then select “Fallback offer.”

2.	For the purposes of the lab, please use this naming convention. (“FallbackOffer + your sandbox number.” Ex: “FallbackOffer24”)

4.	Select “Email” as the channel
5.	Select the Placement you created earlier EX: “EmailBannerPlacement24”
6.	Click “Add content” 
7.	Name the Content with the following naming convention. (“FallBackEmailBanner  + your sandbox number.” Ex: “FallBackEmailBanner24”)
8.	Add the URL to the banner: https://www.moneycrashers.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/open-bank-account-banking-tablet-financial-planning-1068x713.jpg
9.	Add the Destination Link: https://americaspot6-publish.adobedemo.com/content/we-finance-pot/language-masters/en.html
10.	Select “English (United States)” for Language

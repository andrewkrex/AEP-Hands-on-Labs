## Exercise 5 - Create a Collection

Collections allows you to organize your offers by regrouping them into categories of your choice. You can, for example, create a “sport” collection that will contain sport-related offers only.

You can create two types of collections:

Dynamic collections are collections of offers based on tags. These collections are updated automatically. For example, if a new offer is created with the selected tag, it will automatically be added to the collection.

Static collections are collections built by manually selecting individual offers to include in the Collection. The collection can only be updated my manually adding more offers to it.

For the purposes of the Lab, we will create a Dynamic collection.

Create a dynamic Collection

1.	Go to the Collections tab, then click `Create collection`

4.	Select `Create dynamic collection`

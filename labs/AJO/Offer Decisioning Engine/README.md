# Offers Decision Engine - Create, manage, and personalize each customer’s “next best offer” from one system.

## Lab Overview

In this lab you'll use the Offers Decisioning Engine to create 2 offers. One for wealth management and one for an auto loan. Both of these offers will have representations for an email banner, text email and a mobile text. Using profile data from Experience Platform, we will define rules based on customer attributes to present the “best product” offer to a customer across multiple channels.

## Best Practices
To minimize any technical issues as you progress through the exercises, please use a current Chrome browser. It's also highly recommended to have two monitors to easily access the lab curriculum from one screen while you work through the UI on the other screen.


## Use Case
As a Financial Institution, we've invested heavily in the ability to personalize customer experiences. Now, we want to be as contextual and relevant with offers for our customers.
We understand our customer's behaviors and we want to deliver the right personalized Auto loan or Wealth Management offer at the right time from a central library of marketing offers.

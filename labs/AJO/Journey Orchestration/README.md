## Lab Overview

In this lab you'll use Journey Orchestration to listen to customer behavior, both online and offline, and respond to it in an intelligent, contextual and real-time way.


## Use Case
As a brand, we've invested heavily in personalizing customer experiences. Now, we want to be as contextual and relevant for offline experiences.
We want to understand customer's behavior and deliver personalized experience, showcasing relevant content to that customer, we want to deliver a personalized Push or SMS Message to that same customer, all in real-time.
We also understand that context greatly impacts a customer's interest, so we want to bring in the current weather information of that customer's location.

Introduction to Analysis Workspace Interface
The left side rail contains the Panel menu (where new panels can be dragged to the project), the Visualization menu (where visualizations can be dragged to a panel), and the Components menu (where Dimensions, Metrics and Filters are found and can be dragged to the panel visualizations).
If you're familiar with Workspace Analysis, you'll notice several features in CJA have been renamed to align with industry standards. Some updated names include:
Segments are now known as 'Filters'
Virtual Report Suites are now known as 'Data Views'
Classifications are now known as 'Lookup datasets'
Customer attributes are now known as 'Profile datasets'
Hit containers are now known as 'Event' containers
Visit containers are now known as 'Session' containers
Visitor containers are now known as 'Person' containers

Introduction to Analysis Workspace Interface:
-----------------
The left side rail contains the Panel menu (where new panels can be dragged to the project), the Visualization menu (where visualizations can be dragged to a panel), and the Components menu (where Dimensions, Metrics and Filters are found and can be dragged to the panel visualizations).
If you're familiar with Adobe Analytics Workspace Analysis, you'll notice several features in CJA have been renamed to align with industry standards. Some updated names include:
- Segments are now known as 'Filters'
- Virtual Report Suites are now known as 'Data Views'
- Classifications are now known as 'Lookup datasets'
- Customer attributes are now known as 'Profile datasets'
- Hit containers are now known as 'Event' containers
- Visit containers are now known as 'Session' containers
- Visitor containers are now known as 'Person' containers


**ATTRIBUTION IQ**

Attribution IQ can be used to dig a bit deeper into this analysis use case. Attribution IQ allows users to measure the influence that any data point has on driving an event of interest.
In most cases, people think of measuring the influence of marketing touches on driving conversions when talking about attribution. Attribution IQ supports this use case very well, but it can also be used for many other use cases. For example, measuring the influence of web pages on driving calls.
Let's start with the marketing use case.

1. Create a new panel with a Freeform Table and title it “Attribution IQ”. Ensure your date range for POT5 is March 18-30, 2020. Drag the “Web Marketing Channel” dimension & drop it into the panel, then add in the “Sessions” & “Online Purchases” metrics:

      <kbd><img src="./images/cja-attributioniq-createpanel1.png"  /></kbd>

This table shows the performance of these Marketing Channels on driving Online Purchases from a Last Touch perspective. This is because the Marketing Channel dimension is setup to use a default attribution model of Last Touch. But using Attribution IQ, users can dynamically change the model being used on the fly. Let's change the model being used now.

2. Hover over the “Online Purchases" metric in the table and click on the gear icon when it appears. This will open column settings. 
In column settings, click on the "Use non-default attribution model" checkbox down in the Data settings section to enable Attribution IQ on this metric. This will open the Attribution IQ configuration window. 
From here we can select the Attribution Model and Lookback Window.
Click on the Model drop-down list to access all the attribution models available and select “Linear”
Click on the Lookback window drop-down and select “Person (Reporting Window)” and click Apply

**Notes on Attribution Model selection**: Let's say that as a business we've determined that the Linear Model is the model that makes the most sense to use because it splits the credit across all the touches that a customer has leading up to a conversion, opposed to just one touch. Depending on the analysis scenario, we may want to use different Attribution Models. Attribution IQ provides the flexibility to select the model that makes the most sense for the job.

**Notes on Lookback window selection**: Selecting “Session” means that we will only give credit to touches that occur prior to a conversion within a Session.
“Person” means Touches across Sessions can be given credit within the Reporting Timeframe of the Panel. We’ve selected “Person” because a person may have multiple marketing interactions across multiple Sessions on their path to a conversion.
